### The app idea
A content sharing platform for sharing study notes and helpful resources, in order to aid in remote study.

### My role
My main role in this project was to write unit tests and UI tests, aiding in the automatic build process when merging our work on github.

The tests are limited as our UI and functionality have many dependencies, so tests can't be written in isolation.
I also had trouble trying to create a local database for testing purposes, using firebase frameworks.

I had also built a pdf viewer, and a video-recorder with playback-viewer which were not included in the final submission.
